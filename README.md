## Automatic NPC Disabler Script

### Description

The Automatic NPC Disabler script automatically prevents non-playable characters (NPCs) such as pedestrians and cars from spawning in your FiveM server.

### Purpose

This script operates silently in the background to create a controlled environment by disabling NPCs. It's designed to enhance specific server activities, events, or roleplay scenarios where NPC interference is undesirable.

### Installation

1. Ensure your FiveM server is running and accessible.
2. Place the `npc_disabler.lua` script in your server's resource folder.
3. Add `ensure npc_disabler` to your server.cfg to start the script on server startup.

### Notes

- This script does not require any user commands. It automatically disables NPCs upon initialization.
- Customize the script as needed to integrate with other server functionalities or configurations.
- Ensure compatibility with your existing FiveM server scripts and resources.
